This tutorial demonstrates the simplest possible usage of Acquia Pipelines. The Pipelines YAML file simply creates a plain-text file,
hello.txt, containing the text "Hello, Pipelines."

To use it clear out a branch in your Acquia Cloud repo so that only the tutorial files are included.
Then commit all the files from this folder into your Acquia Cloud repository, push them to Cloud, then run ```pipelines start```.
