# Building Drupal with Composer

* [Download files](http://tutorials.pipeline-dev.services.acquia.io/pipelinestutorial201.zip)

This tutorial demonstrates the ability to build a Drupal site with Composer, with only the essential
local files (e.g.: not the vendor directory or contributed modules) committed to the source branch.  It builds Acquia Lightning, based on the [Lightning Project](https://github.com/acquia/lightning-project). To use it clear out a branch in your Acquia Cloud repo so that only the tutorial files are included. Then commit all the files from this folder into your Acquia Cloud repository, push them to Cloud, then run ```pipelines start```.

To get the files, clone this repository and grab the tutorial-201 folder, or you can [download the ZIP file here](http://tutorials.pipeline-dev.services.acquia.io/pipelinestutorial201.zip).

Notes:

* We have already set up this folder to contain the output from "composer create-project" and pre-populated settings.php with database
  configuration and profile name.  Doing that set up from scratch will be the subject of a different tutorial.
* An environment running this cannot currently be cloned into Dev Desktop due to a number of complex integration issues.

After the Pipelines build is complete, you can install Lighting on Cloud via drush:

* drush @<<pipelinesdemo>>.test ac-code-path-deploy pipelines-build-master
* drush @<<pipelinesdemo>>.test ac-task-info <<14726779>>
* drush @<<pipelinesdemo>>.test site-install
* drush @<<pipelinesdemo>>.test ac-domain-list

Take the username and password from the site install command response and enter it at the domain provided by ac-domain-list
